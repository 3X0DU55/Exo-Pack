I have banded a small team but everything added so far has been sprited by me (Hours of reteaching code aside), except for the crescent moon I do not remember who made it so please message me on discord (I presume you could find me on the spriters discord) and I will credit you
V0.0.1
7 New Weapons
1 New Soul (Jungle)
3 New Ores (Not worldspawned yet)
3 New Bars (No uses yet)
Anvil and Forge to go with the new ores, once again pointless now
